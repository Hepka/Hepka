### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**Hepka/Hepka** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on HHBots
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on DemetryF
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about VK Bots on JS
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: hepka@hepka.tk
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not a gay:)
